# Explore US Bikeshare Data
This is a learning project I have built while studying for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. 
It's using Pyhon to import US bike share data from csv files and answer questions by computing descriptive statistics. It uses the console to provide an interactive environment for the user. Original csv files ware truncated to save space / improve download.

## What I learned:
* Python data types and structures: dictionaries and list comprehensions
* Control flow (looping using an *action tracker* with options to *go back* and *jump to*)
* Extract data from csv 
* Use of imported packages (Pandas library for data manipulation) along with Pipenv for virtual environment and dependencies
* Validate and process console input from user through interactive question-answering

## Usage (command line):
1. To install dependencies (Pandas): navigate to your cloned repo and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pipenv install` if using `pipenv`
2. Run `bikeshare.py`

### Notes to students:
